                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10">Question 01: Discuss the scope of var, let, and const.</h3>
                <p class="text-base font-normal mt-7"><span class="font-bold">Answer:</span> The scope of var, let, and
                    const.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="font-medium">Var:</span> The scope of a variable declared with var is function-level or
                    global. This means that a variable
                    declared with var is accessible throughout the function in which it's declared or globally if
                    declared
                    outside of any function.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="font-medium">Let:</span> The keyword let in Javascript is used to declare a variable
                    that
                    is block scoped in JavaScript. In
                    JavaScript, the var keyword is typically used to declare a variable that is treated like any other
                    variable, whereas variables declared using the let in JavaScript are block scoped.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="font-medium">Const:</span> The scope of a const variable is block scope. It can be
                    updated
                    and re-declared into the scope.
                    It can be updated but cannot be re-declared into the scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared into
                    the
                    scope. Variables declared outside of any functions and blocks are global and are said to have Global
                    Scope

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10">Question 02: Tell us the use cases of null and undefined.</h3>
                <p class="text-base font-normal mt-7"><span class="font-bold">Answer:</span> The use cases of null and
                    undefined.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="font-medium">Null:</span> Null is used in programming to represent the absence of data
                    or
                    undefined values. Common use cases include handling missing information in databases, setting
                    default
                    values for variables, and checking for errors or optional data. It's a placeholder that helps
                    distinguish between no data and zero or empty values, aiding in data integrity and conditional
                    logic.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="font-medium">Undefined:</span>In JavaScript, undefined serves several important use
                    cases:
                    Variable Initialization, Function Return, Missing Object Properties, Callback Handling, Optional
                    Parameters, Testing Existence, Default Values, Array Elements, JSON Parsing, Error Handling etc.
                    Overall, undefined helps handle missing or uninitialized values in JavaScript programs.

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10">Question 03: What do you mean by REST API?</h3>
                <p class="text-base font-normal mt-7"><span class="font-bold">Answer:</span> The REST API.
                    <br><br>
                    A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that
                    conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web
                    services. REST stands for representational state transfer and was created by computer scientist Roy
                    Fielding.
                    <br><br>
                    An API is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. Itâ€™s
                    sometimes referred to as a contract between an information provider and an information user
                    establishingthe content required from the consumer (the call) and the content required by the
                    producer (the
                    response). For example, the API design for a weather service could specify that the user supply a
                    zip
                    code and that the producer reply with a 2-part answer, the first being the high temperature, and the
                    second being the low.

                    In other words, if you want to interact with a computer or system to retrieve information or perform
                    a
                    function, an API helps you communicate what you want to that system so it can understand and fulfill
                    the
                    request.
